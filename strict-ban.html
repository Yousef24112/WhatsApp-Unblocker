      <textarea id="response">Hello dear WhatsApp Support, I am Joseph Michael from Germany and I am communicating with you today regarding my WhatsApp account. Your system has suspected me and therefore my phone number has been blocked from using WhatsApp and I do not know why this was done to me. I was using WhatsApp to message my family and complete my work through it and when I contacted you A previous time, my message was answered. Our system monitored that your account activity violates the terms of service, and your account will remain banned. I know the terms of service and WhatsApp policy well, and I did not do anything to be banned from using WhatsApp. If you think that I am using the unofficial WhatsApp and modified by Jailbreak, I will tell you this. Error: I am using the official WhatsApp with the latest version on Google Play, and I cannot use a modified WhatsApp. I also cannot add people to WhatsApp groups, and I am not in their contacts. I cannot violate the terms of service in any way, because the WhatsApp application is very important to my life, and I cannot Doing something that harms WhatsApp or harms WhatsApp users. I have been using WhatsApp since 2015, and I know that the WhatsApp system is good and cannot fail a WhatsApp user if he asks for help. I am now asking for help in unblocking my number, and I will use WhatsApp as an administrator, and if your system detects that it has blocked my account by mistake, you must search. I have an acceptable excuse for this error that came from your system, and I want you to review my previous account activity from my chat backup to ensure that I did not violate the terms of service earlier or sooner, and I hope to solve this problem as soon as possible because I want to communicate with my family and communicate in my work, and I apologize. For any confusion or inconvenience, thank you. This is my phone number (+20)</textarea>
